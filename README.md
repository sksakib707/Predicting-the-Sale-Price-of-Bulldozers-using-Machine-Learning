# Predicting-the-Sale-Price-of-Bulldozers-using-Machine-Learning
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict the future sale price of used bulldozers, using the dataset from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition. The goal is to develop a high-quality regression model that can estimate auction prices based on historical equipment sale data.
##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **regression model** that predicts the sale price of a bulldozer using a large dataset from the **Kaggle Blue Book for Bulldozers** competition.

This project demonstrates:

- Comprehensive **data cleaning and preprocessing**
- **Handling large time-series datasets**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (dates, categories, missing values)
- RandomizedSearchCV
- Training machine learning models:
  - Random Forest Regressor   
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation using:
  - RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error)
  - R² Score
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

##  Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

##  Dataset

The dataset used is the **Blue Book for Bulldozers** dataset from **Kaggle**, which contains auction data for thousands of bulldozers.

It includes features such as:

- Model ID  
- Usage hours  
- Year made  
- Product size  
- Auction date  
- Machine condition  
- Hydraulic options  
- And more…

This dataset is ideal for learning **regression modeling** and **feature engineering**.

##  Model Performance

After extensive experimentation, the best-performing model achieved:

- ✔ **Low RMSLE error**  
- ✔ Strong generalization on validation data  
- ✔ Improved accuracy with feature engineering and time-based split  

(Random Forest Regressor often performs strongly on this dataset.)
