# Predicting-the-Sale-Price-of-Bulldozers-using-Machine-Learning
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict the future sale price of used bulldozers, using the dataset from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition. The goal is to develop a high-quality regression model that can estimate auction prices based on historical equipment sale data.
